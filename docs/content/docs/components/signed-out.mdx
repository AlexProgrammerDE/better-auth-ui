title: <SignedOut>
---

The `<SignedOut>` component conditionally renders its children only when the user is not authenticated. It is a simple helper for handling UI components or pages that should only be accessible by guests (unauthenticated users).

Use this component to conditionally hide or show content based on the user's authentication status.

## Usage

Wrap any content that should be displayed only to signed-out (unauthenticated) users within the `<SignedOut>` component:

```tsx
import { SignedOut } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"

export default function Example() {
    return (
        <SignedOut>
            <div>You need to log in to access this feature.</div>
        </SignedOut>
    )
}
```

## Example

A practical view managing authentication states using both [`<SignedIn>`](/components/signed-in) and `<SignedOut>` components together:

```tsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"

export default function Navbar() {
    return (
        <nav className="flex items-center justify-between px-4 h-14 border-b">
            <h1 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                Better Auth UI
            </h1>

            <div className="flex gap-3 items-center">
                <SignedOut>
                    <a href="/auth/sign-in" className="text-sm font-medium">
                        Sign In
                    </SignedOut>

                <SignedOut>
                    <a href="/auth/sign-up" className="text-sm font-medium">Create account</a>
                </SignedOut>

                <UserButton />
            </div>
        </nav>
    )
}
```

This setup neatly handles cases where certain UI elements should only appear to unauthenticated visitors, enhancing control and improving the overall user experience.

## Practical Use Cases

The `<SignedOut>` component is especially useful when:

- You want to display sign-up or login specific messaging and CTAs exclusively to unauthenticated users.
- Encouraging unauthorized visitors to sign in or create an account.
- Clearly signposting functionality or features that require authentication before access.
