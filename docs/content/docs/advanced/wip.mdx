## Advanced Configuration

### Create Custom Authentication Flow

You may use `additionalFields` to define extra fields required during signup or settings:

```tsx
<AuthUIProvider
  authClient={authClient}
  additionalFields={{
    company: {
      label: "Company",
      placeholder: "Your company name",
      description: "Enter your company name",
      required: true,
      type: "string"
    },
    age: {
      label: "Age",
      placeholder: "Your age",
      description: "Enter your age",
      required: false,
      type: "number"
    }
  }}
>
  {children}
</AuthUIProvider>
```
