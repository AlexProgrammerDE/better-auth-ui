The `AdditionalFields` interface allows you to define custom fields for your authentication flow such as signup or user settings.

## Usage

You can configure `additionalFields` like this:

```tsx
<AuthUIProvider
  authClient={authClient}
  additionalFields={{
    age: {
      label: "Age",
      placeholder: "Your age",
      description: "Enter your age",
      required: true,
      type: "number"
    },
    newsletter: {
      label: "Newsletter Opt-In",
      description: "Subscribe to the newsletter",
      required: false,
      type: "boolean",
    }
  }}
>
  {children}
</AuthUIProvider>
```
